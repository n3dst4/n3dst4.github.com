Welcome to the future! It's 20x5 and we now live in a [post-scarcity economy][pse].

Kinda. We still have hunger and poverty and only one season of Firefly, but for those of us lucky enough to call ourselves programmers, we really are living in a kind of utopia. All the things we work with on a day-to-day basis are free.

I don't mean the [tools][atom] or the [platforms][node] although lots of those are free. I mean the actual building blocks of our work: files, packages, modules; whatever you call them in your platform of choice.
